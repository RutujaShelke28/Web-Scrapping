# Web-Scrapping
This project focuses on extracting useful information from websites using web scraping techniques in Python. The objective is to automatically collect structured data from web pages and convert it into a usable format for analysis and storage.

The project uses Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup, Requests, and Pandas to fetch web page content, parse HTML elements, and extract relevant data such as text, links, tables, or product information. Proper handling of HTTP requests, response status codes, and webpage structure is implemented to ensure reliable data extraction.

The scraped data is cleaned and organized into structured formats like CSV or DataFrame for further analysis. This project demonstrates how web scraping can be applied to real-world use cases such as data collection, market analysis, price comparison, and research automation.

The project follows ethical scraping practices by respecting website structure and avoiding excessive requests. Overall, this project provides a practical understanding of web scraping concepts, HTML parsing, and automated data collection using Python.
